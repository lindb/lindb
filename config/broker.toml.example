## logging related configuration.
[logging]
## Dir is the output directory for log-files
## Default: /tmp/lindb/log

## MaxBackups is the maximum number of old log files to retain. The default
## is to retain all old log files (though MaxAge may still cause them to get deleted.)
## Default: 3

## MaxAge is the maximum number of days to retain old log files based on the
## timestamp encoded in their filename.  Note that a day is defined as 24 hours
## and may not exactly correspond to calendar days due to daylight savings, leap seconds, etc.
## The default is not to remove old log files based on age.
